    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am an American singer/songwriter and instrumentalist. I am signed to Warner
    Music Nashville, have been since high school. I have been performing and
    writing music every since the age of four, and that passion has only grown
    since then.  I am passionate about my music, all music really and I enjoy
    learning how to play different instruments. One of the hardest instruments I
    had to learn was the pedal guitar, but I thoroughly enjoyed the challenge.</p>

          Overall, Hunter Hayes delights on his latest country single "Heartbreak."
           The radio airwaves ought to give it the airplay that it deserves
           since Hayes is one of the most gifted and underrated male artists
           in the contemporary country music scene, from a singer-songwriter
           and multi-instrumentalist standpoint. He has proved time and time
           again that he can do it all. "Heartbreak" garners an A rating.

        In a world that sometimes forces us to be who we are not in the hopes of
        pleasing the people around us, leave it to Hunter Hayes to release a song
        that speaks that truth, no matter how much it hurts. In the new music video
        for the song “Dear God,” Hayes reveals his personal truth not only through
        the lyrics of the song, but also in a raw, slightly psychedelic-looking
        video that showcases Hayes pondering the question: "Am I ever really good
        enough?
